# Red Star Bot - Extra Plugins
![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7-blue.svg)

Extra plugins for the [Red Star Discord bot](https://github.com/medeor413/Red_Star) that don't really fit in the core files, generally because their functions are not recognized as essential.

# Installation
Simply download the .py files and drop them in your Red Star user folder's plugins folder, or in the installation's plugins folder if you use portable mode.
# Usage and Documentation
Visit [our wiki](https://github.com/medeor413/Red_Star_Plugins/wiki) for usage information and detailed documentation on plugins. Plugin authors are invited to create a page for their plugins.
# Contributing
Feel free to make your own plugins and contribute them to this repo by pull request, if you so desire!
This repository is for any and all plugins. You can also add your own plugin repo to the README, if you'd rather keep your own work separate.

We don't yet have API documentation or style guidelines, so you'll unfortunately have to look at the existing code samples and glean things from there.
Try to make your plugin follow similar conventions to the core plugins.

If you feel your plugin adds sufficiently "core" or "essential" features that can be and are used by the majority of Red Star users,
you may submit them to [the main repo](https://github.com/medeor413/Red_Star) to be integrated into the core distribution at the maintainers' discretion.
